# Rust for JavaScript Developers

## Author's Note

This project was created in 2024, when the Rust programming language was trending. I created this project just to follow the trend, but as someone who primarily writes frontend projects, I realized I didn't need Rust. I don't have any projects that require Rust, including in its main domains like systems programming or frontend toolchain development. Rust is harder than JS, and I don't like difficult things. Consequently, this repository has received no updates since 2024.

Nevertheless, this project gained several stars in the second half of 2025, which indicates that for some reason, someone needs it. Therefore, I have decided to unarchive this project. However, since I don't use Rust, I will not update this repository until the first issue is raised.
