# Rust for JavaScript Developers

This book is **under construction**. Currently, there is a shortage of people for this project. If you like the project, please consider contributing to accelerate the development of the project.

This book is adapted from Microsoft's [Rust for C#/.NET Developers](https://github.com/microsoft/rust-for-dotnet-devs).

The document sources can be found in the `src` directory. It is structured for
rendering with [mdBook].

[Install mdBook] locally or start-up [`devcontainer.json`]. If you've never
used Dev Containers, check out [Developing inside a Container using Visual
Studio Code Remote Development][vscode-dc].

Then to render for reading in a Web browser, run:

    mdbook serve

  [mdBook]: https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/

  [`devcontainer.json`]: .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
